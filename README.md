# Bug-Report
I'm not used to use this platform as a user since I only used once to create a repository a year ago so this is kinda my first attempt to understand the concept of the system. 

I would like to start with a subject **Bug Report** on this repository. 

**Note:** The below *Test Area* is an indepedent place for my testings so not a direct relation exists. (I know I could write all those extra lines into a new file, maybe I'll do it later)

# Test Area
Revert test __directly__ through GitHub web interface with pull request (since it's stated that it can only be done for pull requests (PR) through the interface)
